{"name":"ppt_rasterize","tagline":"Make your slides not shift - rasterize them!","body":"Rasterization is a process of converting some vector data into images.\r\n\r\nRasterization of a presentation means converting it into a slideshow consisting of images of original slides.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Why should I rasterize my presentations?\r\n\r\nBecause you want your presentation look the same everywhere.\r\n\r\nYou just don't want the following to happen:\r\n\r\n* Something may shift on different version of PowerPoint.\r\n\r\n* Some fonts may be missing on other computers.\r\n\r\nAfter you have rastized your presentation, you don't have to worry about this. Since it's roughly a set of pictures, it does not require any fonts, and the text and pictures on slides can't shift. Yous slides will look the same everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What if...\r\n\r\n## ... my presentation has transistion effects between slides?\r\n\r\nThey will be preserved. Don't worry.\r\n\r\n## ... my presentation contains notes?\r\n\r\nThey will be preserved as well.\r\n\r\n## ... my slides contain media?\r\n\r\nAll media is copied over slide images so you'll still be able to play audio/video while presenting your rasterized slides.\r\n\r\n## ... my slides contain animation?\r\n\r\nThey will become static. Don't use animation if you want your slides to look the same everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\n## 1. [Download][installer] and run the installer\r\n\r\n## 2. Locate the presentation in Windows Explorer\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/62722148/img/ppt_rasterize/1.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## 3. Right-click on it and select \"Rasterize\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/62722148/img/ppt_rasterize/2.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## 4. Check your rasterized presentation\r\n\r\nYou will get two files:\r\n\r\n* PPS - PowerPoint slide-show with notes, media and transistion effects between slides preserved;\r\n* PDF - file for presenting on computers with no PowerPoint but with Acrobat Reader.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/62722148/img/ppt_rasterize/3.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe files produced are not editable. They are to be shown. After changing the source presentation, you need to rasterize it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[installer]: http://j.mp/ppt_rasterize\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
