Rasterization is a process of converting some vector data into images.

Rasterization of a presentation means converting it into a slideshow consisting of images of original slides.


# Why should I rasterize my presentations?

Because you want your presentation look the same everywhere.

You just don't want the following to happen:

* Something may shift on different version of PowerPoint.

* Some fonts may be missing on other computers.

After you have rastized your presentation, you don't have to worry about this. Since it's roughly a set of pictures, it does not require any fonts, and the text and pictures on slides can't shift. Yous slides will look the same everywhere.


# What if...

## ... my presentation has transistion effects between slides?

They will be preserved. Don't worry.

## ... my presentation contains notes?

They will be preserved as well.

## ... my slides contain media?

All media is copied over slide images so you'll still be able to play audio/video while presenting your rasterized slides.

## ... my slides contain animation?

They will become static. Don't use animation if you want your slides to look the same everywhere.

</p>

## 4. Check your rasterized presentation

You will get two files:

* PPS - PowerPoint slide-show with notes, media and transistion effects between slides preserved;
* PDF - file for presenting on computers with no PowerPoint but with Acrobat Reader.

The files produced are not editable. They are to be shown. After changing the source presentation, you need to rasterize it again.
