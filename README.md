Do you have a PowerPoint presentation and want to present it somewhere? So do I. But I am not sure if the computer I will present it on will have the same version of PowerPoint and all fonts required by my presentation. The solution is to rasterize my slides so they look same anywhere.

This little tool does exactly this. Moreover, it preserves the transition effects between the slides. Just [download][installer] (only 7 kilobytes!) and run the installer. It does not require admin rights. It will add a popup menu command for PowerPoint files.

# 1. [Download][installer] and run

# 2. Locate the presentation in Explorer

# 3. Right-click on it and select "Rasterize"

# 4. You will get two rasterized files: PDF and PPS
