Story: Farsighted Presenter rasterizes his slides

As a Farsighted Presenter
I want to rasterize my slides
So that they do not shift when presenting

Scenario 1: The presentation file exists
Given the presentation file "Presentation.pptx" exists
When the Farsighted Presenter chooses the "Rasterize" command from the context menu
Then the program should rasterize the slides
 And the program should save rasterized slides into the "Presentation - rasterized.pps" slide show

Scenario 2: Wrong file name
Given the presentation file "Presentation.pptx" does not exist
When the Farsighted Presenter invokes the "ppt_rasterize Presentation.pptx" command
Then the program should say that it can't find the file

Scenario 3: No file name
When the Farsighted Presenter invokes the "ppt_rasterize" command without arguments
Then the program should explain how to use it
